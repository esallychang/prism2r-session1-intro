    "text": "What is RStudio?\nRStudio is freely available open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE). RStudio provides an environment with many features to make using R easier and is a great alternative to working on R in the terminal.\n\n\nGraphical user interface, not just a command prompt\nGreat learning tool\nFree for academic use\nPlatform agnostic\nOpen source\n\n\nLocalPosit Cloud\n\n\n\nCreate a new project directory in RStudio\nLet’s create a new project directory for our “Introduction to R” lesson today.\n\nOpen RStudio\nGo to the File menu and select New Project.\nIn the New Project window, choose New Directory. Then, choose New Project. Name your new directory Intro-to-R and then “Create the project as subdirectory of:” the Desktop (or location of your choice).\nClick on Create Project.\n\n\n\nAfter your project is completed, if the project does not automatically open in RStudio, then go to the File menu, select Open Project, and choose Intro-to-R.Rproj.\nWhen RStudio opens, you will see three panels in the window.\nGo to the File menu and select New File, and select R Script.\nGo to the File menu and select Save As..., type Intro-to-R.R and select Save\n\n\nThe RStudio interface should now look like the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nRStudio interface\n\n\n\nWhat is a project in RStudio?\nIt is simply a directory that contains everything related your analyses for a specific project. RStudio projects are useful when you are working on context- specific analyses and you wish to keep them separate. When creating a project in RStudio you associate it with a working directory of your choice (either an existing one, or a new one). A . RProj file is created within that directory and that keeps track of your command history and variables in the environment. The . RProj file can be used to open the project in its current state but at a later date.\nWhen a project is (re) opened within RStudio the following actions are taken:\n\nA new R session (process) is started\nThe .RData file in the project’s main directory is loaded, populating the environment with any objects that were present when the project was closed.\nThe .Rhistory file in the project’s main directory is loaded into the RStudio History pane (and used for Console Up/Down arrow command history).\nThe current working directory is set to the project directory.\nPreviously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs\nOther RStudio settings (e.g. active tabs, splitter positions, etc.) are restored to where they were the last time the project was closed.\n\nInformation adapted from RStudio Support Site\n\n\n\nAdding directories\nIn order to add a directory, or folder, within your RStudio project, you can click the “Create a new folder” button at the top-left of the Files/Plots/Packages/Help window. It looks like a folder with a plus sign on top of it. Let’s name the directory scripts and click “OK”.\nNext, we are going to add the data directory:\n\nThis directory can be downloaded from here. Right-click on this link and select “Save Link As…”.\nNavigate to your RStudio project and save the file.\nGo to the file in your file browser and double-click on the data.zip file to uncompress it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWindows users will need to check that within the data folder, there isn’t a second data directory within the data directory. If there is, bring the nested data directory out of the data directory and place it directly within your RStudio project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Posit Cloud?\nPosit is the open-source data science company who manages RStudio. While many R users download Rstudio to run their analyses locally, Posit offers a service called Posit Cloud which allows users to carry out their analyses in the cloud. There are advantages to this model including:\n\nYour analyses are available from any computer in the world\nSharing Rstudio projects can be easier\n\n\nHowever, there are restrictions on the free accounts that come from Posit Cloud including:\n\nMaximum of 25 projects\n25 compute hours per month\n1GB maximum of RAM\n\n\n\nWhy are we using Posit Cloud?\nGiven the restrictions on compute time and RAM, you might wonder why we are teaching you R using Posit Cloud? And the answer is that Posit Cloud offers a great environment for teaching from and all of the principles that we learn using R and RStudio on Posit Cloud will apply to your local installation of R and RStudio as well. Some of these benefits include:\n\nShared operating system for package installations\nShared versions of R and packages\nAllows instructors to take control of your RStudio environment to help troubleshoot issues\nCan pre-load data to analyze\n\nOur recommendation is for you to familiarize yourself with R and RStudio in this workshop in a common shared environment on Posit Cloud and then take these skills with you and implement them on your own analyses on a local installation of R and RStudio.\n\n\nEntering the Introduction to R Workspace on Posit Cloud\nBefore you are able to use Posit Cloud, you will need to make a free account on Posit by following this link if you have not done so already. Once you have made an account on Posit Cloud, the instructors for the workshop will have shared a link with you to join the Introduction to R workspace hosted by the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core or you can click this link.

This way, you have a complete record of what you did, you can easily show others how you did it and you can do it again later on if needed.\nThe Rstudio script editor allows you to ‘send’ the current line or the currently highlighted text to the R console by clicking on the Run button in the upper-right hand corner of the script editor.\nNow let’s try entering commands to the script editor and using the comments character # to add descriptions and highlighting the text to run:\n\n# Intro to R Lesson\n# July 7th, 2025\n\n# Interacting with R\n\n# Add 3 and 5\n3 + 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can send code to the console from the script editor to be run by pressing the Ctrl and Return/Enter keys at the same time as a shortcut.\n\n\n\nYou should see the command run in the console and output the result.\n\nWhat happens if we do that same command without the comment symbol #? Re-run the command after removing the # sign in the front:\n\nAdd 3 and 5\n3 + 5\n\nError in parse(text = input): &lt;text&gt;:1:5: unexpected numeric constant\n1: Add 3\n        ^\n\n\nNow R is trying to run that sentence as a command, and it doesn’t work. We get an error in the console.\nThis means that the R interpreter did not know what to do with that command. Reintroduce the # to re-comment the appropriate line.\n\n\nConsole command prompt\nInterpreting the command prompt can help understand when R is ready to accept commands. Below lists the different states of the command prompt and how you can exit a command:\nConsole is ready to accept commands: &gt;.\nIf R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a &gt; prompt.\nWhen the console receives a command (by directly typing into the console or running from the script editor (Ctrl-Enter), R will try to execute it.\nAfter running, the console will show the results and come back with a new &gt; prompt to wait for new commands.\nConsole is waiting for you to enter more data: +.\nIf R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t complete yet, the console will show a + prompt. It means that you haven’t finished entering a complete command. Often this can be due to you having not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation.\nEscaping a command and getting a new prompt: ESC\nIf you’re in Rstudio and you can’t figure out why your command isn’t running, you can click inside the console window and press ESC to escape the command and bring back a new prompt &gt;.\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts in RStudio\nIn addition to some of the shortcuts described earlier in this lesson, we have listed a few more that can be helpful as you work in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey\naction\n\n\n\n\nCtrl+Enter\nRun command from the script editor in the console\n\n\nESC\nEscape the current command to return to the command prompt\n\n\nCtrl+1\nMove cursor from console to script editor\n\n\nCtrl+2\nMove cursor from script editor to console\n\n\nTab\nUse this key to complete a file path\n\n\nCtrl+Shift+C\nComment the block of highlighted text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise 2\n\n\n\nTry highlighting only 3 + from your script editor and running it. Find a way to bring back the command prompt &gt; in the console.",

    "section": "Variables",
    "text": "Variables\nA variable is a symbolic name for (or reference to) information. Variables in computer programming are analogous to “buckets”, where information can be maintained and referenced. On the outside of the bucket is a name. When referring to the bucket, we use the name of the bucket, not the data stored in the bucket.\nIn the example above, we created a variable or a “bucket” called x. Inside we put a value, 3.\nLet’s create another variable called y and give it a value of 5.\n\n# Assign the value of 5 to the object called y\ny &lt;- 5\n\nWhen assigning a value to an variable, R does not print anything to the console. You can force it to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the variable name.\n\n# Print the object y\ny\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nYou can also view information on the variable by looking in your Environment window in the upper right-hand corner of the RStudio interface.\n\n\n\nNow we can reference these buckets by name to perform mathematical operations on the values contained within. What do you get in the console for the following operation:\n\n# Add x and y\nx + y\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nTry assigning the results of this operation to another variable called number.\n\n# Add x and y and assign their sum to the object called number\nnumber &lt;- x + y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExercise 3\n\n\n\nTry changing the value of the variable x to 5. What happens to number?\nNow try changing the value of variable y to contain the value 10. What do you need to do, to update the variable number?\n\n\n\nTips on variable names\nVariables can be given almost any name, such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. However, there are some rules / suggestions you should keep in mind:\n\nMake your names explicit and not too long.\nAvoid names starting with a number (2x is not valid but x2 is)\nAvoid names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for, see here for a complete list). In general, even if it’s allowed, it’s best to not use other function names (e.g., c, T, mean, data) as variable names. When in doubt, you can check the “Help” tab to see if the name is already in use.\nAvoid dots (.) within a variable name, as in my.dataset. There are many functions in R with dots in their names for historical reasons, but because dots have a special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages, it’s best to avoid them.\nUse nouns for object names and verbs for function names\nKeep in mind that R is case sensitive (e.g., genome_length is different from Genome_length)\nBe consistent with the styling of your code (where you put spaces, how you name variable, etc.). In R, two popular style guides are Hadley Wickham’s style guide and Google’s.",

    "text": "Interacting with data in R\nR is commonly used for handling big data, and so it only makes sense that we learn about R in the context of some kind of relevant data. Let’s take a few minutes to familiarize ourselves with the data.\n\nVisualizing the provided files\nYou can access the files we need for this workshop by clicking on the data/ directory within the “Files” tab. Within here, you should find the four files that we will be working with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you wanted to add files onto the Posit Cloud server you could do this with the “Upload” button in the “Files” tab.\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset\nIn this example dataset, we have collected whole brain samples from 12 mice and want to evaluate expression differences between them. The expression data represents normalized count data obtained from RNA-sequencing of the 12 brain samples. This data is stored in a comma separated values (CSV) file as a 2-dimensional matrix, with each row corresponding to a gene and each column corresponding to a sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe metadata\nWe have another file in which we identify information about the data or metadata. Our metadata is also stored in a CSV file. In this file, each row corresponds to a sample and each column contains some information about each sample.\nThe first column contains the row names, and note that these are identical to the column names in our expression data file above (albeit, in a slightly different order). The next few columns contain information about our samples that allow us to categorize them. For example, the second column contains genotype information for each sample. Each sample is classified in one of two categories: Wt (wild type) or KO (knockout). What types of categories do you observe in the remaining columns?\n\n\n\nR is particularly good at handling this type of categorical data. Rather than simply storing this information as text, the data ican be represented in a specific data structure which allows the user to sort and manipulate the data in a quick and efficient manner. We will discuss this in more detail as we go through the different lessons in R!\n\n\nThe functional analysis results\nWe will be using the results from a functional analysis to learn about packages/functions from the Tidyverse suite of integrated packages. These packages are designed to work together to make common data science operations, like data wrangling, tidying, reading/writing, parsing and visualizing, more user-friendly.\n\n\nAdditional datasets\nThere are a handful of additional data sets within the data directory that we will use during this workshop as toy data sets. Some of the datasets are only used as toy data sets in optional lessons.",

Our end goal is not just to “do stuff”, but to do it in a way that anyone can easily and exactly replicate our workflow and results. All code should be written in the script editor and saved to file, rather than working in the console.\nThe R console should be mainly used to inspect objects, test a function or get help.\nUse # signs to comment. Comment liberally in your R scripts. This will help future you and other collaborators know what each line of code (or code block) was meant to do. Anything to the right of a # is ignored by R. A shortcut for this is Ctrl+Shift+C if you want to comment an entire chunk of text.",
